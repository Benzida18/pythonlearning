ðŸŒ± Python Learning Journey

Welcome! This repository tracks my personal journey as I learn Python from the ground up.

Iâ€™m currently focused on building foundational skills through small projects and exercises. Each file here reflects a concept or topic Iâ€™ve recently learned, practiced, and understood at a starter level.

âœ… What Iâ€™ve Learned So Far

ðŸ§  Data Types

Iâ€™ve learned the four fundamental data types:
	â€¢	Integers (int) â€“ Whole numbers like 5, -2, 100
	â€¢	Floats (float) â€“ Numbers with decimals like 3.14, -0.5
	â€¢	Strings (str) â€“ Text values like 'hello', '123'
	â€¢	Booleans (bool) â€“ True or False, used in logic and comparisons

ðŸ§® Variables & Assignment

I now understand how to store and reuse values by assigning them to variables using =:

name = "Alice"
age = 25

âž• Operators

Iâ€™ve explored:
	â€¢	Arithmetic operators: +, -, *, /, % (modulus), ** (exponentiation)
	â€¢	Relational operators: >, <, ==, !=, >=, <=
	â€¢	Assignment operators: =, +=, -=, etc. â€” helpful for updating values efficiently

ðŸŽ¯ Initial Pattern & Basic Logic

I learned to identify and apply patterns such as:
	â€¢	Repeating tasks using variables
	â€¢	Using expressions like a ** b to handle powers and exponents
	â€¢	Writing clear and consistent code layouts (clean indentation, naming)

ðŸ§¾ User Input

I practiced how to capture data from users with the input() function:

name = input("What is your name? ")

This is useful for building interactive programs.

ðŸ”€ Control Flow (if statements)

I learned how to use conditional logic:
	â€¢	if to check a condition
	â€¢	elif for alternate checks
	â€¢	else for fallback logic

Example:

if age >= 18:
    print("Adult")
else:
    print("Minor")

This allows my code to make decisions based on values.

ðŸ§ª Project 1: Temperature Converter

File: temperature.py

This is a small script that converts a temperature from Fahrenheit to Celsius using:

C = (F - 32) / 1.8

In this task, I applied:
	â€¢	Variables to store temperature
	â€¢	Arithmetic operators to compute Celsius
	â€¢	Print formatting with round()
	â€¢	Step-by-step code structure with comments for clarity

Example Output:

Temperature in Celsius: 27.78

This project helped me understand how mathematical logic can be translated into Python code.

ðŸš€ Next Steps

As I continue to learn Python, I will begin exploring:
	â€¢	Loops (for, while) to repeat tasks
	â€¢	Functions to reuse code
	â€¢	Lists and basic data structures
	â€¢	File handling and reading from files

Each new concept will be committed with a clearly named file and short explanation.

Stay tuned, and feel free to follow along as I learn!
